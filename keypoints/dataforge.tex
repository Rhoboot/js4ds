\begin{itemize}
\item
  Create a \texttt{DataFrame} from an array of objects with identical keys,
  from a spec with \texttt{columnNames} and \texttt{rows} fields,
  or by parsing text that contains CSV or JSON.

\item
  If you're using a loop on a dataframe,
  you're doing the wrong thing.

\item
  Use method chaining to create pipelines
  that filter data and create new values from old.

\item
  Use grouping and aggregation to summarize data.
\end{itemize}
